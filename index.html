      <h2 class="h2">(*•‿•*) About me: My name is Michelle Liu and I am a third-year student
        at UChicago  who loves music. I played classical piano and flute for 11 years, 
        but I also grew up with a love for rock music. I started getting into metal music a few years
        ago, so below, I will list some of my favorite metal albums and why I think they are amazing!!⋆｡°✩
        ⋆｡°✩⋆｡°✩
      </h2>
    </div>
    <img src="guitar.gif" alt="guitar gif" class="center">
    <img src="gojira.jpg" alt="From Mars to Sirius album cover" class="border">
    <h2>♫ Gojira, From Mars to Sirius (2005)</h2>
    <p>✮⋆˙Genre: Progressive Metal,  ✮⋆˙Favorite Song: Flying Whales</p>
    <p>"From Mars to Sirius" paints a beautiful storyline of the rebirth of a dead planet and
    tackles environmental issues and their impact on marine life. Not just focused on the environment,
    the album deals with larger themes of life, death, and rebirth, and the storytelling method reminds
    me greatly of Pink Floyd's "Animals".
    The tumultous soundscape and call to action against climate change is what makes this album so amazing to me.</p>
    
    <img src="slipknot.png" alt="Iowa album cover" class="border">
    <h2>♫ Slipknot, Iowa (2001)</h2>
    <p>✮⋆˙Genre: Nu Metal,  ✮⋆˙Favorite Song: Disasterpiece</p>
    <p>I was never into Slipknot until I heard "Iowa". Songs like "Disasterpiece" and "People=Shit"
    embody anger and pain in such an incredible way, and you can truly feel the hardships the band
    was going through at that time. The title track is an indescribable soundscape, and reminds me 
    of "Revolution 9" by The Beatles. The instrumental is extremely technical and even so,
    the entire album is emotional and raw. </p>
    
    <img src="soad.png" alt="Toxicity album cover" class="border">
    <h2>♫ System Of A Down, Toxicity (2001)</h2>
    <p>✮⋆˙Genre: Nu Metal,  ✮⋆˙Favorite Song: Needles</p>
    <p>"Toxicity" by System Of A Down is incredible! From the political outcry of "Prison Song",
    to the floaty sound of "Aerials", the album is truly a rollercoaster. "Chop Suey!" is a song
    many people like myself grew up hearing in the 2000's. I have probably heard the song
    hundreds of times and Serj and Daron's harmonizations in the last part of the song
    still give me the chills. Getting more into System Of A Down's other music, I always find the political and social
    commentary and their music fascinating, and an outlook into the early 2000s.</p>
    
    <img src="deftones.jpg" alt="White Pony album cover" class="border">
    <h2>♫ Deftones, White Pony (2000)</h2>
    <p>✮⋆˙Genre: Alternative Metal,  ✮⋆˙Favorite Song: Pink Maggit</p>
    <p>"White Pony" is meticulous and fascinating. Chino Moreno's versatile and unique voice
    really shines in this album, from his longing sound in "Change In the House of Flies" to the harsh vocals of "Elite".
    The band's heavy shoegaze influence is prevalent and the band breaks through their nu-metal 
    categorization with this revolutionary album. I personally love how the album goes full circle, 
    beginning with "Mini Maggit" and ending on "Pink Maggit".</p>

    <img src="tool.png" alt="AEnima album cover" class="border">
    <h2>♫ TOOL, AEnima (1996)</h2>
    <p>✮⋆˙Genre: Progressive Metal,  ✮⋆˙Favorite Song: Jimmy</p>
    <p>AEnima by TOOL is a bold and innovative album with a mystical sound. The sound is 
    simultaneously heavy yet soft, intense yet beautiful, and deep yet humorous. AEnima is one of those
    albums where I can remember exactly where and when I was when I first listened to it. Not to mention
    the album cover is amazing! (definitely need it in my CD collection (-‿◦☀)~)
    </p>
    
    <img src="judaspriest.png" alt="Painkiller album cover" class="border">
    <h2>♫ Judas Priest, Painkiller (1990)</h2>
    <p>✮⋆˙Genre: Speed Metal,  ✮⋆˙Favorite Song: All Guns Blazing</p>
    <p>"Painkiller" has crazy, wailing vocals, like AC/DC but amped up 20x. The pure speed, instrumental
    intensity, creative riffs, and high-pitched vocals make it a wild ride. This is one of my favorite 
    albums for if I need an energy boost. I always enjoy watching Judas Priest perform these songs,
    where they really seem to feed off each others' and the crowds energy, making for really exciting live
    performances. </p>
    
    <img src="pantera.png" alt="Cowboys From Hell album cover" class="border">
    <h2>♫ Pantera, Cowboys From Hell (1990)</h2>
    <p>✮⋆˙Genre: Groove Metal,  ✮⋆˙Favorite Song: Domination</p>
    <p>"Domination" was one of the first songs I heard when I was getting into metal
    and the guitar solo blew my mind. Then, I watched Pantera's Moscow 91 performance of the song and was even 
    more amazed. Listening to this album and more Pantera songs,
    their creativity and passionate, emotional guitar solos will always inspire me (such as Floods and 10's). The 
    interplay between guitar and voice in "Cemetary Gates" and the heavy breakdown of "Domination"
    are a couple of the standouts for me. </p>
    
    <img src="metallica.png" alt="Ride The Lightning album cover" class="border">
    <h2>♫ Metallica, Ride The Lightning (1984)</h2>
    <p>✮⋆˙Genre: Thrash Metal,  ✮⋆˙Favorite Song: Creeping Death</p>
    <p>And of course I had to include Metallica! Metallica expanded in such a beautiful way
      from their previous album "Kill 'Em All" to "Ride The Lightning", utilizing acoustic sounds,
      extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. I really love the transitions in each of the songs, 
      including the intro of "Fade to Black" and the heavy half time sound of 
      "Creeping Death". This coupled with the sheer technical ability
      of the band's members makes the album unforgettable.
